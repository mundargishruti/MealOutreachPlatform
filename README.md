# MealOutreachPlatform
Project Description
Topic: Meal Outreach
Objective: A Swing Application to provide food to the beneficiaries at a reduced cost and using EBT cards for transactions that involve meal or food items.
A beneficiary is a person who has come to the foodbank to order food. The food bank accountant will create the order for the beneficiary. Once the order is created a Volunteer will be assigned to the order who would the process the order as per the requirement. To complete the order the volunteer must collaborate with the Food Bank Storage Space or restaurants to make the ordered food available. Once the requirements are fulfilled the order would be completed
The restaurants have the option to Accept or Reject the order. On acceptance the restaurant processes the order. The same goes for the Food Bank Storage. Once they process the order the assigned volunteer for the order is informed who in turn marks the order as completed. 
Once the order is completed the Accountant is notified to process the billing. The Accountant also has the feature to see the pie chart of the orders. To process the billing the accountant must either send the claim to the EBT Card agency (For beneficiaries with the card) else the bill is processed at the food bank.
The EBT agency along with creating various types of cards and enrolling card holders also accepts or rejects the reimbursement of the food ordered by the customers. 
The EBT Planner is for creating various type of cards for varied patients.  The customers would be assigned to a suitable card by the EBT Agent.
The foodbank also consults with the FDA to approve the restaurants they plan to tie up with. They request the reports of those hospitals from the FDA. The FDA is a hierarchical enterprise with Food Inspector, FDA Secretary and FDA Manager. Once the Food inspector inspects the restaurant he sends the report to the secretary who then sends it to the manager for approval. 
The food bank can also ask NGO for contributions in the form of funds. It sends its request to the NGO volunteer who then forward it to the director. 
-This is how a Food Bank could operate efficiently.
